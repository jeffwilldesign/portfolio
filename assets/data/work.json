        "Sedona Taphouse, a growing restaurant chain focused on craft beers and locally-sourced ingredients in a seasonal menu, sought to refresh their website to showcase their food and atmosphere with rich photography. Working with the design team, we created a range of page templates that placed photography first while supporting text content with subtle design elements and textures found across the Sedona Taphouse brand. We collaborated with the strategy team to create streamlined user experiences for finding nearby locations, local menus and online ordering options using browser geolocation data that lowered barriers and increased user engagement."

        "With seniors increasingly using online tools to find information and services, Seniors Guide, a regional magazine and online resource for seniors, saw an opportunity to update their online presence with a refreshed brand and an increased focus on search. Working closely with the strategy team, we created a robust taxonomy to dynamically display relevant services and content throughout the site based on a user’s location. The new taxonomy also provided a foundation for a powerful search experience with a custom API and a responsive front-end application built in Vue.js. Collaborating with the design team, we crafted a completely refreshed design system focused on readability and usability for an audience that often faces challenges navigating sites as content rich as Seniors Guide. Along with the refreshed design system that brought a clean modern look to the site, we also brought modern technologies and coding practices to the project that give Seniors Guide a solid foundation for continued growth of their online presence."

        "Created in 1944, Smokey Bear&rsquo;s message on wildfire prevention has served as the longest running public service campaign in the nation&rsquo;s history. As the lead developer on the team, I was selected to research the campaign&rsquo;s audience, write personas and lead an audience-focused redesign of the campaign&rsquo;s website. The redesigned <a href='https://smokeybear.com/' target='_blank'>SmokeyBear.com</a> places heavy emphasis on educational content and vibrant imagery granting the user an investment in protecting U.S. wildlands, while also modernizing Smokey Bear. From an educational standpoint, the new site features resources that affirm facts on wildfire prevention and safety as well as the benefits of prescribed fires by professionals.",
        "Focusing on a wide-ranging audience of kids, parents, educators and outdoor enthusiasts, content is depicted through infographics and images simple enough for youth to comprehend, yet advanced enough to interest adults. Also another inherent-yet-often-overlooked nuance of the site is ensuring it meets accessibility requirements so users who may need special assistance can still engage.",
        "Every page and piece of information on the site is now easy to share, enlisting users to boost Smokey&rsquo;s message. Built with a mobile-first strategic focus, the redesigned site eliminates any barriers to the user experience regardless of technology platform. Additionally, the new site moves away from depreciated technologies and establishes a JavaScript standard to ensure scalability and flexibility as Smokey forges ahead for another 70 years."

With the goal of providing more value to its community of travelers, I worked with the Marriott content and design teams to deliver a thoughtful, strategic and creative digital solution to reach travel audiences, especially millennials, using content as the primary driver",
        "Marriott Traveler is part lifestyle magazine and part social media hub, featuring content centered around culture, family, fashion, food &amp; drink and more. I was an integral part of the process, from developing the flexible information architecture of the content and the layout of its pages; creatively consulting on the user experience design to leading the development of a responsive, mobile-optimized platform that curates content from Marriott staff, travel writers and influencers. Initial launch of the site focused on the pilot destination of New Orleans, with more cities following over the course of the year. The site is designed to encourage users to seamlessly share content, all before finally making the decision to book with a property.",

        "In 2017, Stay Teen dedicated an entire month to focus communications around the issue, and I worked alongside the SJ&amp;P design team to lead the development of its flagship element, a mobile-focused game called Level Up: An Epic Swiping Adventure. The immersive game allows players to create a customized character to represent themselves throughout the experience in which the levels mimic the cadence of a school year, along with customizing their personal crush.",
        "The gameplay is designed to pit the players against all of the pressures and challenges teens face today that could sway their judgement and knowledge about relationships and sex, including drugs and alcohol, peer influence and pressure to have sex. As the pressures advance, users vanquish them by swiping in the appropriate shape on their screen, earning special powers along the way — represented by personified birth control &ldquo;heroes,&rdquo; each with their own educational tips and methods of defeating enemies.",
        "While the game is optimized for mobile devices, it&rsquo;s also playable on desktops to ensure maximum reach and engagement among its audience."

The content hub was thoughtfully designed with a look and feel that is unique from the DiscoveryEducation.com website in order to differentiate the two and position the content hub as an accurate information source. The design elements are bold, with delightful animations to give the site a playful and modern feel. We also carefully integrated conversion touchpoints in a way that is valuable to users versus an overt sell."
